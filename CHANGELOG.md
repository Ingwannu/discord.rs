# Changelog

## 1.2.0

- Added a `voice-encode` feature with optional `opus-rs` support, including `PcmFrame`, `AudioSource`, `AudioMixer`, and `VoiceOpusEncoder` for 48 kHz stereo 20 ms PCM-to-Opus playback through the existing voice runtime.
- Added outbound voice playback plumbing for encoded Opus frames, RTP sequence/timestamp/nonce management, and automatic speaking on/off behavior around playback.
- Added DAVE outbound media support with `VoiceDaveySession`, `VoiceDaveFrameEncryptor`, `send_opus_frame_with_dave(...)`, and typed DAVE MLS gateway commands for transition-ready, key-package, commit/welcome, and invalid commit/welcome flows.
- Added an ignored live DAVE MLS transition harness (`tests/live_voice_dave.rs`) so production interoperability can be verified against a real Discord voice session without running live network tests by default.
- Expanded Gateway typed coverage, EventHandler convenience hooks, request-guild-members helpers, interaction payload fields, application command fields, and richer Activity/Presence models.
- Added OAuth2 backend helpers, typed REST coverage for moderation/application/guild administration gaps, and continued the split of HTTP helper/path/body/rate-limit code away from the monolithic HTTP client.
- Added cache storage and eviction controls for guild metadata, emojis, stickers, scheduled events, stage instances, voice state, soundboard, and other long-running bot data.
- Hardened collector deadlines, shard IPC lifetime, voice heartbeat nonce generation, gateway outbound scheduling, reconnect jitter, and HTTP rate-limit bucket cleanup.
- Made coverage reporting stricter by removing broad coverage ignore shortcuts and keeping the release gate on real all-features line coverage.
- Updated README, USAGE, Docsify docs, and the `discordrs-dev` Codex skill guidance for the `1.2.0` public surface.

## 1.1.0

- Added Discord Gateway `zlib-stream` handling that keeps compressed payload state across binary frames and inflates only complete payload boundaries.
- Added multipart file upload support through `reqwest`'s multipart feature, including typed message, webhook, and interaction attachment helpers.
- Added typed webhook message CRUD helpers for token-authenticated webhook message fetch, edit, and delete flows.
- Added typed Poll models and REST/event coverage for poll payloads, vote events, and poll ending.
- Expanded Auto Moderation, Scheduled Event, Audit Log, Sticker, Stage Instance, Welcome Screen, Guild Onboarding, Guild Template, Invite, Integration, Forum, Soundboard, Subscription, SKU, and Entitlement models and REST/event coverage.
- Expanded cache coverage for emoji, stickers, voice states, presences, threads, webhooks, scheduled events, AutoMod rules, invites, integrations, soundboard sounds, and monetization entities with cache policy toggles.
- Added voice receive support for raw UDP packets, RTP parsing, AES-GCM and XChaCha RTP-size transport decrypt, and pure-Rust Opus PCM decoding.
- Added experimental `dave` feature support for DAVE/MLS frame parsing, state tracking, and a `davey`/OpenMLS-backed decryptor hook. Live Discord DAVE interoperability still requires real voice gateway transition testing.
- Changed the HTTP User-Agent version to use `env!("CARGO_PKG_VERSION")` so future package versions no longer need a hard-coded request-header update.
- Updated README, USAGE, Docsify docs, and the `discordrs-dev` Codex skill guidance for the `1.1.0` public surface.

## 1.0.0

- **BREAKING**: Removed the legacy raw `RestClient` convenience methods (`send_message`, `edit_message`, `create_dm_channel`, `create_interaction_response`, and `bulk_overwrite_global_commands`) from the public API. The typed `RestClient` surface is now the supported path, and internal JSON helpers remain crate-private.
- **BREAKING**: Builder implementation submodules are now private. Import builders from `discordrs::builders::{...}` or the crate root re-exports instead of deeper paths such as `discordrs::builders::modal::*`.
- **BREAKING**: `ApplicationCommand` no longer implements `DiscordModel`. Use `ApplicationCommand::id_opt()` and `ApplicationCommand::created_at()` for optional-ID command values.
- Changed gateway event processing to preserve ordering through a dedicated event processor instead of unbounded per-event task spawning.
- Changed unsupported gateway `compress=zlib-stream` configuration to be stripped from normalized URLs so the runtime no longer advertises a mode it cannot process.
- Changed interaction request verification to reject stale or future timestamps outside a five-minute freshness window.
- Hardened token-authenticated callback/webhook HTTP paths by rejecting unsafe path segments and omitting bot `Authorization` headers from `/interactions/...` and `/webhooks/...` requests.
- Fixed gateway Identify/Resume payloads to use the raw Discord token instead of an HTTP-style `Bot ` prefix.
- Fixed REST error typing so Discord API failures now surface as `DiscordError::Api` / `DiscordError::RateLimit` instead of collapsing into model errors.
- Fixed typed command and autocomplete interactions to preserve nested option `value` / `focused` input data through `CommandInteractionOption`.
- Changed voice state handling to clear stale runtime/session state on disconnect and endpoint loss.
- Fixed stale interaction examples in `USAGE.md` to match the current typed helper and typed endpoint APIs.
- Added README / USAGE migration notes for the tightened public API surface and canonical replacement paths.

## 0.4.0

- Fixed gateway cache consistency after the upgrade: `READY` now clears stale cache state, `MESSAGE_UPDATE` merges partial payloads into cached messages instead of wiping fields, and guild/channel/bulk-delete paths now evict dependent cached entries.
- Fixed `EventHandler` typed dispatch so `ready`, `message_create`, `interaction_create`, and the newly-added typed event hooks receive typed payloads, while `raw_event` is reserved for unknown events.
- Fixed REST command registration safety so legacy global-command overwrite helpers now reject missing `application_id`, matching the typed command paths.
- Fixed REST route-key normalization so major parameters (`applications`, `channels`, `guilds`, `webhooks`) keep distinct rate-limit buckets.
- Fixed `EmbedBuilder::timestamp_now()` to emit Discord-compatible UTC ISO 8601 timestamps instead of a placeholder string.
- Added typed `Snowflake`, `PermissionsBitField`, `User`, `Guild`, `Channel`, `Member`, `Role`, `Message`, `ApplicationCommand`, and typed interaction variants for chat-input, context-menu, autocomplete, component, and modal submit flows.
- Added typed `Event` decoding and the new `Client` / `ClientBuilder` gateway runtime surface while keeping `BotClient` and `BotClientBuilder` compatibility aliases.
- Added `Context::new(http, data)` so test code and helper crates can still construct a standalone `Context` outside the live gateway runtime.
- Added `RestClient` as the preferred HTTP-facing surface while keeping `DiscordHttpClient` as a compatibility alias.
- Added shared route/global rate-limit tracking for REST requests instead of a single retry-only 429 path.
- Added typed command builders: `SlashCommandBuilder`, `UserCommandBuilder`, `MessageCommandBuilder`, and `CommandOptionBuilder`, including common shortcut helpers for option-heavy slash commands.
- Added `MessageBuilder` and `InteractionResponseBuilder` so common message and interaction response bodies no longer need hand-written JSON.
- Added typed helper paths such as `send_message`, `respond_to_interaction`, `respond_with_message`, `followup_message`, `defer_interaction`, and `update_interaction_message`.
- Added typed interactions endpoint helpers: `TypedInteractionHandler`, `try_typed_interactions_endpoint`, and `typed_interactions_endpoint`.
- Added cache managers behind the `cache` feature and collectors behind the `collectors` feature.
- Added `prelude` re-exports for common runtime, builder, helper, and response types.
- Added `ws` gateway config abstraction and promoted it into the public surface for reusable gateway URL, shard, and encoding configuration.
- Added shard control primitives: `ShardConfig`, `ShardInfo`, `ShardIpcMessage`, `ShardRuntimeStatus`, `ShardingManager`, `ShardMessenger`, and `ShardSupervisor`.
- Added shard-local gateway control from `Context` and `ShardMessenger`, including presence updates, reconnect, shutdown, and voice state update payloads.
- Added supervisor-level shard control helpers so sharded runtimes can drive reconnect, presence, and voice state updates without bypassing the shard IPC layer.
- Added queued shard boot behavior so multi-shard startup does not identify every shard immediately, and exposed `ShardRuntimeState::Queued` to make that lifecycle visible.
- Added shutdown waiting helpers: `ShardSupervisor::shutdown_and_wait()` and `ShardSupervisor::wait_for_shutdown(...)`.
- Added interruptible reconnect backoff so shutdown does not wait for long reconnect sleeps to finish.
- Added `voice` state management plus a `voice_runtime` surface with websocket hello/identify, UDP IP discovery, select-protocol, session-description wait, speaking updates, and graceful close helpers.
- Added checked-in examples for gateway, interactions endpoint, typed interactions endpoint, slash commands, cache, collectors, sharding, and voice runtime setup.
- Added broader tests for typed models, typed events, cache and collectors, sharding state/control, gateway payload helpers, and voice runtime handshake flow.

## 0.3.1

- Added safer builder serialization for buttons and select menus so invalid Discord payload combinations are normalized before send.
- Added modal `FILE_UPLOAD` parsing support and `V2ModalSubmission::get_file_values()`.
- Added explicit follow-up webhook methods that accept `application_id` and fail early when it is missing.
- Added `try_interactions_endpoint()` for startup-time Discord public-key validation.
- Changed gateway reconnect behavior to preserve required resume query parameters and stop retrying documented terminal close codes forever.

## 0.3.0

- **BREAKING**: Complete rewrite from a serenity helper library to a standalone Discord bot framework.
- **BREAKING**: Helper functions now take `&DiscordHttpClient` with raw `&str` and `u64` IDs instead of serenity model types.
- **Added**: Gateway WebSocket client behind the `gateway` feature.
- **Added**: `BotClient`, `BotClientBuilder`, `EventHandler`, `Context`, and `TypeMap` for gateway bot runtime.
- **Added**: `DiscordHttpClient`, a reqwest-based REST client with automatic HTTP 429 retry.
- **Added**: `parse_raw_interaction()` and `parse_interaction_context()` for interaction routing.
- **Added**: `V2ModalSubmission` parser that preserves `Label`, `RadioGroup`, `CheckboxGroup`, `Checkbox`, and other V2 modal components.
- **Added**: `InteractionContext` with `id`, `token`, `application_id`, `guild_id`, `channel_id`, and `user_id`.
- **Added**: HTTP Interactions Endpoint behind the `interactions` feature, including Ed25519 request verification.
- **Removed**: All serenity dependencies.
- **Changed**: Module structure reorganized into dedicated `gateway/`, `parsers/`, and `builders/` directories.

## 0.1.3

- Added modal interaction components:
  - `RadioGroupBuilder` for single-choice selection.
  - `CheckboxGroupBuilder` for multi-choice selection.
  - `CheckboxBuilder` for yes/no style toggles.
- Updated package version to `0.1.3` in `Cargo.toml`.
